AnnotationClustering
======================

The original credit goes to Theodore Calmes who explored annotation clustering in his [blog post](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/how-to-handle-large-amounts-of-data-on-maps). Inspired by his work I created two cocoapods, [SwiftQuadTree](https://github.com/anconaesselmann/SwiftQuadTree) and [ClusteredAnnotations](https://github.com/anconaesselmann/ClusteredAnnotations). This project is [Theodore Calmes's original project](https://github.com/thoughtbot/TBAnnotationClustering) translated to swift, which then uses my two cocoapods (inspired by his work).
